Problem 1:
----------
   
Complete the following program to play guess a number game. The input to the program is a number between 1 - 10.
You should fill in the code in the parts shown by ... to give the player, 5 chances to win. If the player wins 
the game should be stopped to print out the results. 



import java.util.Random;
import java.util.Scanner;

/* This is a program to play the game of Guess a Number.
 * The player gets 5 chances to guess a number between 1 - 10
 */


public class GuessNumber {

public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println(" Welcome ");

    Random rand = new Random();
    Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
    
    int number_guess = rand.nextInt(10)+1;
    int guess;
   
    int i;
	    for(i=1; i<=5; i++){

       System.out.println(" Try too guess a number between 1 and 10 ");
       guess = input.nextInt();
       if (guess == number_guess)
        {
    	   System.out.println(" Congratulations! You Win!!!");
             break;

        }
        else if (guess < number_guess)
        {
            System.out.println(" Guess is too low " + "\n Guess another number to continue");
            
        }
        else if (guess > number_guess)
        {
            System.out.println(" Guess is too high " + "\n Guess another number to continue");
           
        }
 
    }

    System.out.println(" The number was " + number_guess);
    System.out.println(" You were a sport player!");


    }
}

----------
Problem 2:
----------

Try to guess the output of the following Java program first, then run it and compare the results.


public class Mystery{
     public static void main(String[] args) {
         for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= 10; j++) {
                 System.out.print(i * j + "\t");
            }
         System.out.println();
         }
     }
}

a)
My guess is that the code will output a block of numbers that is essentially a times table of (i*j). There will be ten rows and ten columns, each consting of multiples of i and j. 

b)The output was similar to my guess, but there were only nine rows. The code produced a table fo multiplication values that showed the result of (i*j) as i and j were incrementally increased by one each time. 


    
----------
Problem 3:
----------

A variable's scope is the part of a program in which it exists. In Java, the scope of a variable starts when it is declared and ends when the closing curly brace for the block that contains it is reached. 
A variable is said to be in scope where it is accessible.

In which of the two blocks the variable count is accessible? How about variable i?

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int count = 12;
        for (int i = 1; i <= 12; i++) {          
            runSample();
            System.out.print(count);   
        }
    }

    public static void runSample() {
	    System.out.print("sample");
    }
}


ANSWER:
The integer i is declared inside the for loop, and therefor can only be used inside the for loop. After the closed curley braces after the System.out.print(count); the integer i does not exist.

The integer count is accessible in both of the blocks of code; it is declared as a varriable before the for loop, and it exists up until the closed curley braces at the end of the code.

Problem 4:
----------

 Suppose you work as an activity director at Lake Placid Resort, it is your job to
 suggest appropriate activities to guests based on the weather:

  temp >= 80:       swimming
  60 <= temp < 80:  tennis
  40 <= temp < 60:  golf
  temp < 40:        skiing

 a. For this problem,
    *******************************************
    NOTE WELL: Use elses between each if, and be sure that your 
    conditions are no more complex than necessary.
    *******************************************

    Write a program (with class name SuggestActivity) that prompts the
  user for a temperature, then prints out the activity appropriate for
  that temperature.   Note that for this part (part a), your conditions
  will NOT need to contain any logical operators.  If you decide which
  values to compare in the right order all the conditions of the ifs can
  be of the form (temp >= ___), assuming temp is the variable holding
  the value that the user inputted.

 b. Modify your program so that if the temperature is greater than 95
 or less than 20, it prints "Visit our shops!". (Hint: Use a boolean/logical
 operator in this new condition.) For other temperatures print the
 activity as before.

 you only need to submit the revised (b) version.


----------
Problem 5:
----------

Write a Java program that produces the following output:

5
8
11
14
17

Then modify your code to produce the following output: (Note now you will need 
a nested loop.)
