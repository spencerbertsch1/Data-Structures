Purpose: Practice working with the following Java topics: 
         arrays - one and two dimensional,
         static methods,
         scopes.

Problem 1:
----------
   
Suppose you have the opportunity to talk to anybody - living or dead - who would it be?
Run the following program and familiarize yourself with how it works. Then, first change 
the conversational contents of the program such that it reflects a conversation with the person 
you wish. Next, complete the definition of the following static method and use it in your program:


// This method returns true if string a contains string b regardless of their cases.

public static boolean containsIgnoreCase(String a, String b){
     ...
}

public class TalkToMe {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
	    Random rand = new Random();
	    Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
	    String current;
	    boolean Found = false;
		
	    String[] keywords = {"Hello", "fine", "student"};
	    String[][] response = { {"Great! How are you today?", "Ok. How are you?"},
		{"I'm fine as well. What do you do?  ", "I am a fine computer, what are you?"},
		{"I had no idea! What would you like to discuss?", "Interesting! Please tell me more."},
                {"I don't know what you are talking about", "Oh, I see...", "I can't answer that.", "Hmm...Let me think"}
		};
		
	    System.out.println("Hello I am Tulips.");
	    current = input.nextLine();
	    while (!current.contains("bye")) {
	        for (int i=0; i < keywords.length; i++){	
		    if (current.contains(keywords[i])){
				Found = true;
				System.out.println(response[i][rand.nextInt(response[i].length)]);
				break;
		     }

		  }
		  if (!Found )
			System.out.println(response[keywords.length][rand.nextInt(response[keywords.length].length)]);

		  current = input.nextLine();
		  Found = false;
	     }
	     System.out.println("Bye. See you around!");
	     input.close();

	}

}

Here is a sample run:

Hello I am Tulips.
Hello Tulips. How are you?
Great! How are you today?
Fine, thank you.
I'm fine as well. What do you do?  
I am a student.
Interesting! Please tell me more.
I do lots of interesting things: go to classes, study, listen to music,...
I don't know what you are talking about
Ok, never mind now, I have to go bye
Bye. See you around!

 
----------
Problem 2:
----------

Write a Java program to simulate a random draw of 3 volunteers in two ways: 

1. By creating two one dimensional string arrays called: titles and names.
   Populate titles with: "Mr. ", "Mrs. ", "Ms. ", "Dr. ", and populate names with: "Joe ", "Joan ", and
   "Martin ". Next randomly create 3 combinations of title and names. 

2. Create a two dimensional string array populated with the same data to print out the same
   title names combinations from part 1.




    
----------
Problem 3:
----------
What three values are printed by each call below? Write them in comments space provided.


public class MysteryNums {

    static int z = 5;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x = 15;
        sentence(x, 42);      //  
        
        z++;
        int y = x - 5;
        sentence(y, x + y);   //  
    }
    
    public static void sentence(int num1, int num2) {
        System.out.println(num1 + "  " + num2 + "  " + z);
    }
}




The Numbers outputted are as follows:
15   42   5
10   25   6

 
----------
Problem 4:
----------
The following program has 9 errors. Can you find all of them?

public class Parameters {
    public static void main() {
        double bubble = 67.53;
        double x = 10.01;
        printer(double x, double y);
        printer(x);
        printer("barack", "obama");
        System.out.println("z = " + z);
    }

    public static void printer(x, y double) {
        int z = 5;
        System.out.println("x = " + double x + " and y = " + y);
        System.out.println("The value from main is: " + bubble);
    }
}						

The nine errors are as follows
1.There in a unnecessary curley braces at the end of the code. 
2.Printer "barack" , "obama" is not the correct way to call the printer method. 
3.Z is defined in the method, and is'nt in the scope of the main. 
4.Double is defined in the main, but isnt in the scope of the method. 
5.Double is never declared. 
6.Double (x) in printer is declareed twice.
7.Printer (x) does not make sense because x is only one double. 
8.The second Public Static Void should be Double x, Double y to declare the two Doubloe varriables. 
9.Bubble is not defined
