**********************************************************************************

Purpose: Practice interactive programming using the Scanner and JOptionPane classes,
         get familiar with if/else constructs, variables, etc.
         assignment conversion and casting.

***********************************************************************************
Problem 1:
----------
   
Complete the following program to determine the age of a user by using just the year
part of the input. The input to the program includes a month, day, and year of birth.
The program then prints the birthdate in a suitable format and computes the age.

You can create a class called Age in Eclipse and then copy/paste the code below into
it. 

// ********************************************************************************
// 
//   Age.java
// 
//   Computes the age of the user given the birthday
// 
// *********************************************************************************
 
import javax.swing.JOptionPane;

public class Age
{
   public static void main (String[] args)
   {
      int    year, age;
      String day_string, month_string, yr_string; // input Strings 

      // Start conversation
      JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, "Hello there!");          
      day_string = JOptionPane.showInputDialog("On what day of the month you were born? ");
      month_string = JOptionPane.showInputDialog("What is the name of the month in which you were born? ");
      yr_string = JOptionPane.showInputDialog("During what year you were born? ");      
      
      // Compute the age using the year, and the age variables.
      

      
      // Prints the answer
      System.out.println("You were born on " + month_string + " " + 
                                   day_string + ", " + yr_string); 
      System.out.println("You are " + age + " years young!");
   }
}


----------
Problem 2:
----------
Complete the following Java program that uses the Scanner first to read a part-time employee's name and 
then a real number for the employee's pay/hour and an integer for the number of hours the employee worked 
this week. You should compute the amount of employee's paycheck using an if...else statement. 
The employee should receive 'overtime" pay of 1 1/2 normal hourly pay for any hours above 8. 
An example output of this program for $4.00 pay/hour and 11 hours of work will be:

What is your name? George
Hi George, you have earned $50.0.

// This program prompts for information about an employee's work
//  and computes the employee's paycheck

import java.util.*;  // for Scanner

public class PayCheck {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		double pay;
		Scanner c1 = new Scanner(System.in);
		Scanner c2 = new Scanner(System.in);
		// obtain values
		System.out.println("What is your name? ");
		String name = c1.nextLine();
		System.out.println("How much money are you paid per hour? ");;
		double pay_hour = c2.nextDouble();
		System.out.println("How many hours did you work? ");;
		int hours = c2.nextInt();

		System.out.println();
		
		// compute overall pay





                // print out the result
		System.out.println("Hi " + name + " You have earned: $" + pay);

	}
}

  
----------
Problem 3:
----------
If necessary, use a cast in the following pieces of code to either

 a. get rid of a syntax error, if there is one
OR
 b. if there would be no syntax error and there would be information loss (e.g. truncation) 
    then use a cast to avoid that
OR
 c. if neither situation above occurs, then it does not need a cast

Treat each of the 3 sets of code separately.
Note well: Do not place a cast anywhere that it is not necessary.

If you need to, after you think about the code a little while, feel free 
to place these pieces of code into a program (which you do not need to 
submit) and add print statements to see what the output is or if there
would be a syntax error.

a. 

   int x=5;
   double y;
   y = x * 3;

b.

   double d=4.5;
   int e;
   e = d;

c.

   int a=6, b=7;
   double c;
   c = a/b;



----------
Problem 4:
----------
The following program contains at least 5 mistakes. What are they?


public class Mistakes{
  public static void main(String[] args){
     int a = 7, b = 42;
     if (a < b){
        int smaller = a;
     } else (a => b){
        int smaller = b;
     }
     if {smaller = a} {
        System.out.println("a is the smallest");
  }
} 

The problems are:

1. "b" is not an integer because it is not between 1 and 9. The number '42' is not allowed as an integer. 

2. Missing an end statement, semicolon, after the 42. 

3. The symbol '=>' is backwards, it should look like '>='

4. The equal sign should be in the 'if' section of the statement becuase a cannot be smaller than b is they are equal to eachother. 

5. On the last if statement, it uses curley braces instead of parenthases. 







----------
Problem 5:
----------
Write a Java program called CollegeAdmit that uses the Scanner to read user's input
for a student grade point average and SAT exam score. A GPA below 1.8 will cause the student to 
be rejected, an SAT score below 900 will also cause a rejection. Otherwise the student is accepted.
Here are results of two runs:
----------------------------------------
What is your GPA? 
3.2
What is your SAT score? 
1280Whaty
Congratulations! You were accepted.

What is your GPA? 
3.1
What is your SAT score? 
780
Your SAT score is too low. You were not accepted
