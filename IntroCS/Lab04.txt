Problem 1:
----------
   
Change the following program to simulate rolling two dice. Notice that the program as is, simulates rolling one die. You should use Math.random() method to produce the following output:


2, 3    2, 2    1, 5    6, 3    
3, 5    5, 1    6, 5    3, 5    
5, 2    3, 1    1, 6    2, 6    


// Randomizing dice-rolling program


public class DiceProblem {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub

		// Randomizing dice-rolling program

		
				int i;
				int rand;
				int random;
				for(i=1; i<= 12; i++){
					// pick a random number from 1 to 6 and output it
					rand = 1 + (int)(Math.random()*6);
					random = 1 + (int)(Math.random()*6);
					System.out.print(rand + ",");
					System.out.print(random + "   ");
					// if counter is divisible by 5 begin a new line of output
					if ((i % 4) == 0){
						System.out.println();
					}
				}
				
			}
	}

Problem 2:
----------

Write a Java program which is listening to a user's input to turn on an LED continuously. 
Use a switch statement to turn on one of the three LEDs based on the choice value read from the user. 
The user can enter a number between 1-3 to turn on the corresponding LED and any integer number besides 
these will turn all the LEDs off. Typing -1 would stop the program. 


A sample run can be:


Enter 1-3 to turn one of the three LEDs on;
any integer other than 1-3 to turn them all off (-1 to stop): 
3
LED 3 is ON
Enter 1-3 to turn one of the three LEDs on;
any integer other than 1-3 to turn them all off (-1 to stop): 
2
LED 2 is ON
Enter 1-3 to turn one of the three LEDs on;
any integer other than 1-3 to turn them all off (-1 to stop): 
4
All three LEDs are turned off.
Enter 1-3 to turn one of the three LEDs on;
any integer other than 1-3 to turn them all off (-1 to stop): 
-1

Problem 3:
----------
The following program has at least 5 errors. Copy/paste this code int a class Average and fix the errors. 
Complete the code so it passes the run test. 


import java.util.Scanner;

public class Problem03 {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub

		    Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
		    System.out.println("Enter 10 numbers: ");
		   
		    int[] data = new int[10];
		    for(int i=0; i < 10; i++)
		      data[i] = input.nextInt();

		    int sum = 0;
		    double average;

		    for (int i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
		     sum = sum + data[i];
		    }
		    average = sum / 10.;
		    System.out.println("Average is: " + average);
		 }
		
	}






 
----------
Problem 4:
----------
Fill in the array with the values that would be stored after the following code executes:

int[] x = new int[9];
x[0] = 3;
x[7] = -18;
x[4] = 5;
x[1] = x[0];

int y = x[4]; //y=6
x[4] = 6;
x[y] = x[0] * x[1]; //3*3=9


index	0	1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8
value	3	3			6		9	-18



----------
Problem 5:
----------

Write a Java program that reads the number of elements of an array and then prompts the user to populate the array. Next, the program should print out the array first in forward and then in reverse order.
